# Code-Refactor

## Description

- My motivation is to further my experience with coding.

- The reason to build this project is because I wanted to learn how to refactor an existing code.

- The problems it solved was DRY coding. Also not having an id to fix the broken link.

- I learned to look at the differences between working links and non functional links. How to notice the differences and fix the broken link. Also learned how to simplify CSS classes so there isn't multiple classes with the same styling.
